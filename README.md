# KissAndHug

This repository is used for deployment only. In order to use this Discord bot for personal use, please follow the parent repository (vincenthe789p/KissAndHug),

# Features we are current implementing
- Implement individual channels - each channel has it's own 'version' of the bot, so that multiple games in different channels can be played at the same time, and the loophole of sending a command in a different channel with the bot is rectified.
